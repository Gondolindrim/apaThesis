abstract = {IEEE The purpose of this paper is to explore the applicability of linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems with polytopic uncertainty for modeling and control of islanded DC microgrids under plug-and-play (PnP) functionality of distributed generations (DGs). We develop a robust decentralized voltage control framework to ensure robust stability and reliable operation for islanded DC microgrids. The problem of voltage control of islanded DC microrgids with PnP operation of DGs is formulated as a convex optimization problem with structural constraints on some decision variables. The proposed control scheme offers several advantages including decentralized voltage control with no communication link, transient stability/performance, plug-and-play capability, scalability of design, applicability to microgrids with general topology, and robustness to microgrid uncertainties. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is evaluated through simulation studies carried out in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems Toolbox.},

The developed platform emulates the microgrid network, the distributed energy resources (DER) and their corresponding local controllers on a real-time digital simulator (RTDS). The main microgrid controller functions are implemented on a separate digital controller. The microgrid communication network is implemented in hardware and the messages exchanged are compliant with the IEC 61850 generic object oriented substation event (GOOSE) messaging protocol. An impact assessment of false data injection (FDI) cyber-attacks on the critical microgrid control functions, specifically, loss of load due to under frequency load shedding (UFLS) has been conducted. Mitigation solutions that enhance the resilience of the microgrid to FDI attacks have been proposed. Real-time simulation results are used to quantify the attack's impact and the mitigation scheme effectiveness on the dynamic frequency response of microgrids in terms of reliability metrics, including the amount of load lost, the frequency nadir and the time needed to reach frequency stability. A 25 kV distribution system adapted from a utility feeder and reconfigured as a microgrid has been used as the benchmark test system. Applicable utility grid codes and standards are considered throughout.},

abstract = {In electricity grids the frequency of the voltage is stabilized by a combination of the rotational inertia (rotating mass) of synchronous power generators in the grid and a control algorithm acting on the rotational speed of a number of major synchronous power generators. When in future small non-synchronous generation units replace a significant part of the synchronous power generation capacity, the total rotational inertia of the synchronous generators is decreased significantly. This causes large frequency variations that can end up in an unstable grid. A way to stabilize the grid frequency is to add virtual rotational inertia to the distributed generators. A virtual inertia can be attained for any generator by adding a short-term energy storage to it, combined with a suitable control mechanism for its power electronics converter. In this way a generator can behave like a ldquoVirtual Synchronous Generatorrdquo (VSG) during short time intervals, and contribute to stabilization of the grid frequency.},

abstract = {The necessity to solve global warming problems by reducing $\backslash$CO2 emission in the electricity generation field had led to increasing interest in microgrids (MGs), particularly those containing the renewable sources such as solar and wind generation. Wind speed fluctuations cause high variations in the output power of a wind turbine which cause fluctuations in frequency and voltage of the MG during islanding mode and originate stability problems. In this paper, three techniques are proposed for solving and reducing the consequences of this problem. In the first technique, we develop a new fuzzy logic pitch angle controller. In the second technique, we design an energy-storage ultracapacitor which directly smoothes the output power of the wind turbine and enhances the performance of the MG during the islanding mode. In the third technique, storage batteries are used to support the MG in the islanding mode. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

Similar hierarchical decision architectures have been proposed for microgrids. However, the control objectives in microgrids must be achieved while allowing for robust plug-and-play operation and maximal flexibility, without hierarchical decision making, time-scale separations, and central authorities. Here, we explore control and optimization strategies for the three decision layers and illuminate some possibly-unexpected connections and dependencies among them. Our analysis builds upon first-principle models and decentralized droop control. We investigate distributed architectures for secondary frequency regulation and find that averaging-based distributed controllers using communication among the generation units offer the best combination of flexibility and performance. We further leverage these results to study constrained AC economic dispatch in a tertiary control layer. We show that the minimizers of the economic dispatch problem are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of steady-states reachable by droop control. This equivalence results in simple guidelines to select the droop coefficients, which include the known criteria for load sharing.},

These distributed resources interface converters (DICs) are required to operate in an autonomous fashion without any communication for enhanced reliability. Conventionally, the real power-frequency droop control and the reactive power-voltage droop are adopted as the de-centralized control strategies in these DICs for the autonomous power sharing operations. However, the reactive power sharing of Q-V droop control often deteriorates if there are mismatched transmission line impedance characteristics. In this paper, a Q-V dot droop control method with V dot restoration mechanism is proposed to improve the sharing of reactive power. Its operation principle and control method are explained and analyzed. In addition, simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

High gain angle droop control ensures proper load sharing, especially under weak system conditions. However, it has a negative impact on overall stability. Frequency-domain modeling, eigenvalue analysis, and time-domain simulations are used to demonstrate this conflict. A supplementary loop is proposed around a conventional droop control of each DG converter to stabilize the system while using high angle droop gains. Control loops are based on local power measurement and modulation of the d-axis voltage reference of each converter. Coordinated design of supplementary control loops for each DG is formulated as a parameter optimization problem and solved using an evolutionary technique. The supplementary droop control loop is shown to stabilize the system for a range of operating conditions while ensuring satisfactory load sharing.},

abstract = {In angiosperms, ovules are "packaged" within individual flowers, and an optimal strategy should occur depending on pollination and resource conditions. In animal-pollinated species, wide variation in ovule number per flower occurs, and this contrasts with wind-pollinated plants, where most species possess uniovulate flowers. This pattern is usually explained as an adaptive response to low pollen receipt in wind-pollinated species. Here, we develop a phenotypic model for the evolution of ovule number per flower that incorporates the aerodynamics of pollen capture and a fixed resource pool for provisioning of flowers, ovules, and seeds. Our results challenge the prevailing explanation for the association between uniovulate flowers and wind pollination. We demonstrate that when flowers are small and inexpensive, as they are in wind-pollinated species, ovule number should be minimized and lower than the average number of pollen tubes per style, even under stochastic pollination and fertilization regimes. The model predicts that plants benefit from producing many small inexpensive flowers, even though some flowers capture too few pollen grains to fertilize their ovules. Wind-pollinated plants with numerous flowers distributed throughout the inflorescence, each with a single ovule or a few ovules, sample more of the airstream, and this should maximize pollen capture and seed production.},

After all, individuals have strong incentives to 'free-ride' and therefore not contribute to the provision of public goods.

The microgrid concept provides a quite appealing solution for overcoming the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources and distributed generators into power grids. Advances in the microgrids control have improved the microgrids potential to be integrated into the conventional electrical systems in a higher capacity. This improvement not only covers their internal control performance and connection/disconnection procedures in order to limit the negative dynamic impacts in the network and other connected microgrids, but also includes the grid support functionalities to enhance the global operation of distribution networks. In this paper, a general overview of the main control loops is presented. The microgrid control strategies are classified into four control levels: local, secondary, central and global, where the first three levels are associated with the operation of the microgrid itself, and the fourth level demonstrates to the coordinated operation of the microgrid and neighbor grids as well as the main/host grid.},

A new canonical circuit model is proposed, whose fixed topology contains all the essential input-output and control properties of any d.c.-to-d.c. switching converter, regardless of its detailed configuration, and by which different converters can be characterized in the form of a table conveniently stored in a computer data bank to provide a useful tool for computer-aided design and optimization.

abstract = {In power system, as any inequality between production and consumption results in an instantaneous change in frequency from nominal, frequency should be always monitored and controlled. Traditionally, frequency regulation is provided by varying the power output of generators which have restricted ramp rates. The Automatic Generation Control AGC process performs the task of adjusting system generation to meet the load demand and of regulating the large system frequency changes. A result of the mismatches between system load and system generation, system frequency and the desired value of 50 Hz is the accumulation of time error. How equilibrium system frequency is calculated if load parameters are frequency dependent, and how can frequency be controlled. Also, how do parameters of a speed governor affect generated power. The transient processes before system frequency settles down to steady state. Finally, AGC in what way is it different from governor action. This paper presents new approaches for AGC of power system including two areas having one steam turbines and one hydro turbine tied together through power lines.},

abstract = {This paper presents a robust optimal control strategy for an energy storage system of a grid-connected microgrid. The robust optimal control guarantees the highest possible economic benefit of the control schedule even under the worst case net demand prediction error conditions. Several robust optimization approaches are proposed to formulate a fast optimal control problem. The global optimum of a concise control problem can be found within a short computation time using mixedinteger linear programming. The rolling horizon controller of the energy management system periodically updates the control schedule by solving the control problem. The state of charge of an energy storage system is precisely calculated by the piecewise linearization technique using nonlinear efficiency maps. External working conditions such as peak control and demand response can be dynamically applied during the optimization process. The proposed strategy provides control robustness in terms of cost reduction, precise control, and external effect. Future study will focus on the development of a robust control strategy that considers both the worst and best cases of cost reduction.},

The model analyzed consists of an open-loop wing's airfoil subject to freeplay and linear time-invariant parametric uncertainties. The key steps entailed by the application of the two methodologies and their main features are critically discussed. Emphasis is put on the available insight on the nonlinear postcritical behavior known as limit cycle oscillation. It is proposed a strategy to apply IQCs, typically used to find absolute stability certificates, in this scenario, based on a restricted sector bound condition for the nonlinearity. Another contribution of this paper is to understand how the conservatism usually associated with the IQCs multipliers selection can be overcome by using information coming from the first approach. Nonlinear time-domain simulations showcase the prowess of these approaches in estimating qualitative trends and quantitative response's features.},

In this paper the results of ten months monitoring of the microgrid supplied by the photovoltaic generator and operating in the Mediterranean area have been presented. The microgrid architecture and control strategy have been described. Further, the analysis of the energy exchange between the microgrid and the main grid have been analyzed. A particular attention has been given to the optimization of the renewable energy management as to power the microgrid loads and consequently, to increase the photovoltaic energy self-consumption rate. This was possible thanks to implementation of the energy storage system, coupled with the photovoltaic generator. The obtained results demonstrate the technical feasibility of the microgrid, pointing out how the introduction of the storage improves the photovoltaic energy management. Moreover, it has been shown how the microgrid improves the integration of the photovoltaic system with the main grid. The economic evaluation of the costs incurred for the development and maintenance of the microgrid has been carried out. The analysis has been reported also in terms of levelized cost of energy. The results show that the cost effectiveness of the microgrid is increasing with the system operation life time.},

Common and notable features of these codes include inexact Newton-Krylov methods for solving large-scale nonlinear systems; linear multistep methods for time-dependent problems; a highly modular structure to allow incorporation of different preconditioning and/or linear solver methods; and clear interfaces allowing for users to provide their own data structures underneath the solvers. We describe the current capabilities of the codes, along with some of the algorithms and heuristics used to achieve efficiency and robustness. We also describe how the codes stem from previous and widely used Fortran 77 solvers, and how the codes have been augmented with forward and adjoint methods for carrying out first-order sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameters or initial conditions.},

abstract = {— The state consensus problem among groups of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems is addressed. The systems are assumed to have an identical LPV structure. We consider both homogeneous groups, where the time-varying parameters are identical, and heterogeneous groups, where the parameters can be different for all agents. Motivated by relative sensing we assume static, possibly parameter-varying, diffusive couplings between neighboring agents. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for state consensus and, in the homogeneous case, present design procedures for the coupling gains based on linear matrix inequalities.},

An important policy question is whether these perceptions of health risks may also have resulted in measurable reductions in the value of properties in the vicinity of electrical lines. In this paper, we first discuss some of the reasons why power-frequency lines could cause reductions in property values and review the implications of public concerns about EMF exposure for mitigation initiatives. We then summarize findings, from recent court cases as well as published literature and reports, regarding the observed magnitude and extent of reduced property values. In a final section, we use these results to provide bounds on the extent of likely property value reductions due to concerns about EMF exposure.},

Supervisory power managements have been defined to manage the transitions and to minimize the transients on voltage and frequency. Detailed analyses for islanding, reconnection, and black start are presented for various conditions. The proposed control techniques accept inputs from local measurements and supervisory controls in order to manage the system voltage and frequency.

abstract = {The main goal of this thesis is to study how linear control techniques, used to design the broadly known AVR and PSS controllers, impact the transient stability margin of the One Machine versus Infinite Bus System (OMIB). The one-axis model is adopted for representint the synchronous machine, which consists of a salient-pole hydrogenerator. Then the AVR and PSS models, defined in IEEE Standards 421.5 (2005) and 1110, are presented. The model used to represent the PSS was PSS1A (single-input), defined in Standard 421.5. The DAE equations of the system are numerically integrated and the system is simulated under perturbation and its dynamical response is analyzed. Hopf Bifurcation ocurrences are investigated by parametrization of the system eigenvalues as functions of the controllers gains and time constants. The Bifurcation Diagrams of the system were also determined and plotted. Based on Dynamical Nonlinear Systems Stability Region Theory, the simulations are utilized to build up a Brute-Force Method (BFM) to estimate the Stability Region in four situations: open-loop system (no controllers), controlled by AVR solely, AVR and PSS controlled and without saturators, AVR and PSS controlled but with saturators. Also, the Region is also estimated for various values of controllers parameters (gains). These estimatives are further compared so as to conclude about the controllers impacts on the size of the Stability Region. The main conclusion is that while the open-loop system detains the widest Stability Region, that Region is extremely decreased by inclusion of AVR; the further introduction of the PSS widens back the Region, and finally the introduction of saturators significantly reduces the size of Stability Region. Moreover, when the controllers gains are increased, the Region tends to shrink. Consequently, high gains and saturators have a detrimental effect in the size of the Stability Region and in the margin of transitory stability of power systems.},

Also the radioimmunologically assayed somatomedin and the alkaline phosphatase increased significantly.4.At the start of the first series, two patients showed allergic skin reactions which turned out to be caused by the insufficiently purified preparations. Therapy with extractive preparations was free of such side-effects and fully successful. Both of the patients were atopic. A third child who was also allergic developed after 6-9 months the highest antibody titres seen, combined with a high binding capacity. Also, with this boy, treatment was switched over to pit-hGH, with very good results.5.Two children with pituitary dwarfism already developed in utero high antibody titres against Met-hGH but not against ECP. For this response, neither the Somatonorm nor its impurities can be implicated. Rather, it is the reaction to GH generally, which the organism recognizes as a foreign protein and thus as an antigen. One of the patients stopped growing after nine months. Likewise, pituitary GH did not lead to any further improvement. {\textcopyright} 1986 W.B. Saunders Company.},

abstract = {Microgrids have become an attractive option for distributed generation (DG) with increase in renewable energy sources (RES) and storage systems. The existence of both AC and DC microgrids has led to a new concept of hybrid AC/DC microgrid which consists of both AC and DC grids tied by an interlinking converter (ILC). Such hybrid AC/DC microgrid has the advantages of both AC and DC with increased efficiency and less cost since the conversion between AC and DC is reduced. The management of power in such a grid becomes important for voltage and frequency control. Different voltage and frequency control strategies have been successfully implemented within AC and DC grids, but the control of hybrid microgrid requires further attention with focus on ILC. This study presents an overview of various control schemes used for voltage and frequency regulation in standalone and transition mode operation of hybrid microgrid. A detailed study on hybrid grid structure is presented with different modes of operation. Various ILC strategies based on droop and communication-based control are presented. Based on the analysis, some recommendations are presented for future research.},

To solve such problems, innumerous small scale projects have been implemented around the world either on the improvement of cooking stoves, biogas and others, as well as in generating electricity in decentralized systems. We discuss here the "large scale approach" to solve these problems in Brazil through the introduction of LPG (liquid petroleum gas) in Brazil 70 years ago, all over the country, as a cooking fuel that replaced significantly the use of fuel wood in rural areas. In addition to that, we describe the governmental program (Luz para Todos - LPT - Light for all) introduced more recently to extend the electricity grid to around 10 million people, reducing considerably the number of people without access to electricity in the rural areas of the country. Such experiences and the corresponding lessons learned could be replicated in other developing countries, contributing significantly to poverty alleviation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We explore several basic aspects of chaos, chaotic systems, and non-linear dynamics through three different setups. The logistic map, a canonical one-dimensional system exhibiting surprisingly complex and aperiodic behavior, is modeled as a function of its chaotic parameter. We consider maps of its phase space, and the progression through period-doubling bifurcations to the onset of chaos. The Feigenbaum ratio of successive bifurcation periods is estimated at 4.674, in good agreement with the accepted value. The Liapunov exponent, governing the exponential growth of small perturbations in chaotic systems, is calculated and its fractal structure compared to the corresponding bifurcation diagram for the logistic map. Using a non-linear p-n junction circuit we analyze the return maps and power spectrums of the resulting time series at various types of system behavior. Similarly, an electronic analog to a ball bouncing on a vertically driven table provides insight into real-world applications of chaotic motion. For both systems we calculate the fractal information dimension and compare with theoretical behavior for dissipative versus Hamiltonian systems. 1. INTRODUCTION The investigation of chaos and chaotic systems is a rel-atively new area of research, with strong ties to the fields of physics and applied mathematics. Non-linear dynam-ics is the study of systems whose equations of motion contain non-linear dependence on their state variables. In fact, while chaos frequently occurs in non-linear sys-tems, it can never occur in linear systems. Several basic examples, such as the driven damped harmonic oscillator, exhibit surprising behavior as they pass into the chaotic regime. Theoretical simulation as well as direct experiment al-low us to explore non-linear dynamics and chaos theory. We discuss the defining characteristics of chaotic systems in and the connection to fractal theory in 2. We model the logistic map, a simple one-dimensional system ex-hibiting chaotic behavior, in 3. In 4 and 5 we examine two chaotic circuits, one based on the non-linear relation between current and voltage, the other an electronic ana-log of a ball bouncing on a sinusoidally driven table. For all three systems we examine the period-doubling, bifur-cation route to chaos. Where able we estimate the Lia-punov exponent, Feigenbaum ratio, and the information dimension of the attractors. We present a theoretical bifurcation diagram of the logistic map, as well as exper-imentally measured return maps of the two circuit sys-tems and the power spectrum of the resultant time series at various chaotic periods. Finally, we comment on the differences between these three systems and the various characteristics of chaotic behavior that they exhibit.},

For the estimation model to accurately track the experimentally measured current-voltage (I-V) data, the parameter estimation problem is converted into an optimization problem and a metaheuristic optimization algorithm is used to solve it. Metaheuristics present a fairly acceptable solution to the parameter estimation but the problem of premature convergence still endures. The paper puts forward a new optimization approach using hybrid particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing (HPSOSA) to estimate solar cell parameters in single and double diode models using experimentally measured I-V data. The HPSOSA was capable of achieving a global minimum in all test runs and was significant in alleviating the premature convergence problem. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by comparing it with five different optimization algorithms and performing a statistical analysis. The analysis results clearly indicated that the method was capable of estimating all the model parameters with high precision indicated by low root mean square error RMSE and mean absolute error MAE. The parameter estimation was accurately performed for a commercial (RTC France) solar cell.},

abstract = {Droop control by means of virtual resistance (VR) control loops can be applied to paralleled dc-dc converters for achieving autonomous equal power sharing. However, equal power sharing does not guarantee an efficient operation of the whole system. In order to achieve higher efficiency and lower energy losses, this paper proposes a tertiary control level including an optimization method for achieving efficient operation. As the efficiency of each converter changes with the output power, VR values are set as decision variables for modifying the power sharing ratio among converters. A genetic algorithm is used in searching for a global efficiency optimum. In addition, a secondary control level is added to regulate the output voltage drooped by the VRs. However, system dynamics is affected when shifting up/down the VR references. Therefore, a secondary control for system damping is proposed and applied for maintaining system stability. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of this method. The results show that the system efficiency is improved by using tertiary optimization control and the desired transient response is ensured with system damping secondary control.},

abstract = {Small-signal stability analysis in a power system uses a linearized approximation of its nonlinear model to analyze its behavior when subjected to small perturbations. In this approach, there is an implicit assumption that the perturbations are small enough so the imprecisions of the linear approximation with respect to the nonlinear model remain within an acceptable range. This restricts the validity of the linearized model to a neighborhood of the equilibrium conditions under which the model was obtained. Usually, the size and shape of this neighborhood is determined by the regions in the state-space where no protective limiters are active. However, there may be situations when a relatively small perturbation drives the system to such regions, yet there is still no threat to the stable operation of the system. This paper proposes a method to find an attraction area of the system, using a linearized model with the addition of AVR and PSS output limiters, in such a way that this area includes parts of the regions of the state space where the limiters are active, therefore widening the neighborhood of the equilibrium point where stability is guaranteed. The obtained results show that this attraction area is much larger than the neighborhood defined by the region where the linearized approximation is valid, and also indicate that the linearized model, with the addition of AVR and PSS output limiters, can provide good approximations of the nonlinear system trajectories even in some parts of the regions where the limiters are active. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This work aims at determining the most appropriate sun tracking system. The effect of using different types of sun tracking systems on the flat plate photovoltaic system performance for different sky states has been investigated. Several days representing different seasons have been considered. The corresponding main parameters affecting the amount of the electrical energy output and the gains have then been compared to those experienced with two traditional fixed photovoltaic systems inclined according to a yearly and a seasonal optimum slope. Additionally, five configurations of sun tracking systems have been considered while a seasonal and a yearly optimum slope have been applied to those based on rotating axes systems. Hourly data collected over thirty one days for different seasonal sky conditions have been employed. The daily collected global solar radiation and produced electrical energy as well as the electrical gains related to the different moving panels have been quantified separately for each sky state. It is found that for a completely clear day, the highest obtained gains are those related to the two-axis sun tracker systems while the day length is the main parameter affecting these gains. On the other hand, for the partially clear days, the gain amounts mainly depend on the daily clarity level factors and on the seasonal variation of day length values. For a cloudy day, however, all considered systems produced the same electrical energy. Furthermore, the horizontal position of the photovoltaic panel presented the best performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Photovoltaic (PV) array which is composed of modules is considered as the fundamental power conversion unit of a PV generator system. The PV array has nonlinear characteristics and it is quite expensive and takes much time to get the operating curves of PV array under varying operating conditions. In order to overcome these obstacles, common and simple models of solar panel have been developed and integrated to many engineering software including Matlab/Simulink. However, these models are not adequate for application involving hybrid energy system since they need a flexible tuning of some parameters in the system and not easily understandable for readers to use by themselves. Therefore, this paper presents a step-by-step procedure for the simulation of PV cells/modules/arrays with Tag tools in Matlab/Simulink. A DS-100M solar panel is used as reference model. The operation characteristics of PV array are also investigated at a wide range of operating conditions and physical parameters. Result The output characteristics curves of the model match the characteristics of DS-100M solar panel. The output power, current and voltage decreases when the solar irradiation reduces from 1000 to 100 W/m2. When the temperature decreases, the output power and voltage increases marginally whereas the output current almost keeps constant. Shunt resistance has significant effect on the operating curves of solar PV array as low power output is recorded if the value of shunt resistance varies from 1000 ohms to 0.1 ohms. Conclusion The proposed procedure provides an accurate, reliable and easy-to-tune model of photovoltaic array. Furthermore, it also robust advantageous in investigating the solar PV array operation from different physical parameters (series, shunt resistance, ideality factor, etc.) and working condition ( varying temperature, irradiation and especially partial shadow effect) aspects},

abstract = {Nearly all nontrivial real-world systems are nonlinear dynamical systems. Chaos describes certain nonlinear dynamical systems that have a very sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Chaotic systems are always deterministic and may be very simple, yet they produce completely unpredictable and divergent behavior. Systems of nonlinear equations are difficult to solve analytically, and scientists have relied heavily on visual and qualitative approaches to discover and analyze the dynamics of nonlinearity. Indeed few fields have drawn as heavily from visualization methods for their seminal innovations: from strange attractors, to bifurcation diagrams, to cobweb plots, to phase diagrams and embedding. Although the social sciences are increasingly studying these types of systems, seminal concepts remain murky or loosely adopted. This paper has three aims. First it discusses several visualization methods to critically analyze and understand the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems. Second it introduces to an interdisciplinary audience the foundations of nonlinear dynamics, chaos, fractals, self-similarity, and the limits of prediction – arguing that information visualization is a key way to engage with these concepts. Finally it presents Pynamical, a tool to visualize and explore nonlinear dynamical systems' behavior.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of static stability in electric power systems. The study is based on a model consisting of the classical swing equation characterization for generators and constant admittance, PV bus and/or PQ bus load representations which, in general, leads to a semi-explicit (or constrained) system of differential equations. A precise definition of static stability is given and basic concepts of static bifurcation theory are used to show that this definition does include conventional notions of steady-state stability and voltage collapse, but it provides a basis for rigorous analysis. Static bifurcations of the load flow equations are analyzed using the Liapunov-Schmidt reduction and Taylor series expansion of the resulting reduced bifurcation equation. These procedures have been implemented using symbolic computation (in MASYMA). It is shown that static bifurcations of the load flow equations are associated with either divergence-type instability or loss of causality. Causality issues are found to be an important factor in understanding voltage collapse and play a central role in organizing global power system dynamics when loads other than constant admittance are present.},

abstract = {Nowadays, a large part of the world population lives without access to electricity, principally due to the location, too far from the main grid. Renewable power sources connected in an autonomous local grid are a real opportunity for these communities. These weak electrical grids composed by several microsources, energy storage systems and loads can be considered as islanded microgrids. As it is disconnected from the main grid, the frequency and the voltage of the microgrid have to be controlled. The frequency is generally controlled maintaining the power balance between generation and consumption, using energy storage or dump loads. The voltage regulation is approached in different ways, according with the controller design objectives and the nature of the loads connected to the grid. This paper proposes a review of several voltage and frequency control strategies in islanded microgrids.},

The proposed control strategy utilizes a combination of deadbeat and repetitive control to enhance the performance of the control system under unbalanced and/or distorted load currents. Moreover, a new approach is proposed to maintain the effectiveness of the repetitive control under variable-frequency operational scenarios. Furthermore, the control strategy employs feedforward compensation techniques to mitigate the impact of load dynamics on the regulation process. The performance of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated for single- and multiunit islanded networks, through digital time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.},

To harness maximum power from the PV panel, the charge controller is equipped with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) feature. An efficient algorithm for MPPT is developed which requires less iteration to reach Maximum Power Point (MPP) than the traditional Perturb and Observe (P{\&}O) method. Only an input voltage sensor is needed for the design and algorithm to track the MPP which makes the charge controller cost effective. The performance of this charge controller is demonstrated via simulation in Powersim (PSIM) software using the parameters of a practical solar panel (Sunflower A-300). It has been found that around 50{\%} less iterations are required to track the MPP than the tradition P{\&}O method for the proposed algorithm.},

Many publications in literature have analysed the economic viability of such a solution, and some car manufacturers have recently started running several projects to demonstrate the technical viability of the so-called battery second life. Nevertheless, the degradation behaviour of second life batteries remains unknown and represents one of the biggest gaps in the literature. The present work aims at evaluating the effects of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) NMC/C battery State of Health (SOH) and ageing history over the second life performance, on two different applications: a residential demand management application and a power smoothing renewable integration application. The performance and degradation of second life batteries are assessed both at the cell level and at stack level. Homogeneous and heterogeneous stacks are analysed in order to evaluate the impact of cell-to-cell history and SOH differences over the battery performance and degradation behaviour. Results obtained showed a strong influence of the first life battery ageing history upon the second life battery performance and degradation. Thereby, proper monitoring and battery selection appears crucial to certify the technical viability of battery second life.},

@article{Nasirian2015,
abstract = {A cooperative control paradigm is used to establish a distributed secondary/primary control framework for dc microgrids. The conventional secondary control, that adjusts the voltage set point for the local droop mechanism, is replaced by a voltage regulator and a current regulator. A noise-resilient voltage observer is introduced that uses neighbors' data to estimate the average voltage across the microgrid. The voltage regulator processes this estimation and generates a voltage correction term to adjust the local voltage set point. This adjustment maintains the microgrid voltage level as desired by the tertiary control. The current regulator compares the local per-unit current of each converter with the neighbors' and, accordingly, provides a second voltage correction term to synchronize per-unit currents and, thus, provide proportional load sharing. The proposed controller precisely handles the transmission line impedances. The controller on each converter communicates with only its neighbor converters on a communication graph. The graph is a sparse network of communication links spanned across the microgrid to facilitate data exchange. The global dynamic model of the microgrid is derived, and design guidelines are provided to tune the system's dynamic response. A low-voltage dc microgrid prototype is set up, where the controller performance, noise resiliency, link-failure resiliency, and the plug-and-play capability features are successfully verified.},

abstract = {This article examines the prospects of, and politics and practices around, solar energy in China. It examines two different solar energy technologies, namely, solar photovoltaic (PV) and solar water heaters (SWHs), to understand how different pathways for low-carbon innovation are supported and constrained by (the lack of) political support at the national and local level, the interactions between state and nonstate actors, as well as how they relate to changing practices among consumers. This article also discusses obstacles and trade-offs. We find two very different approaches to solar energy. The solar PV industry in China is experiencing increased domestic growth, after many years of being mainly export-oriented. Prices declined rapidly in recent years, and solar PV also enjoys much political and financial support from the central government and local governments. However, there are high bureaucratic and technical hurdles to get grid connected and access the feed-in-tariff, particularly for individual users. SWHs on the other side are a {\&}ldquo;homegrown{\&}rdquo; Chinese technology that is ubiquitous in China, particularly in rural areas; that is easy to install and use; and that has developed from the grassroots levels to mass products with relatively little government support. Although being largely neglected by high-level discussions and plans, SWHs could contribute much to low-carbon transitions that are driven at the local level in China.{\textless}br/{\textgreater} {\&}copy; 2018, {\&}copy; The Author(s) 2018.},

The computations are illustrated for several power systems. Monte-Carlo optimization techniques are applied to obtain multiple minimum load power margins. The use of load power margin sensitivities to select system controls is discussed},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to conceive the secondary control in droop-controlled microgrids (MGs). The conventional approach is based on restoring the frequency and amplitude deviations produced by the local droop controllers by using an MG central controller (MGCC). A distributed networked control system is used in order to implement a distributed secondary control (DSC), thus avoiding its implementation in MGCC. The proposed approach is not only able to restore frequency and voltage of the MG but also ensures reactive power sharing. The distributed secondary control does not rely on a central control, so that the failure of a single unit will not produce the fail down of the whole system. Experimental results are presented to show the feasibility of the DSC. The time latency and data drop-out limits of the communication systems are studied as well.},

Then, the steady-state characteristics of the system, when subject to constant input voltage and constant external torque, are formulated. Three cases are discussed and, for each case, conditions are derived under which the dynamic characteristics of the system are either of steady-state type, limit cycles or chaotic, thus by properly adjusting some system parameters, the system can exhibit limit cycles (LCs) or chaotic behaviors at will. Finally, computer simulations are presented to verify the existence of strange attractors in the PMSM.},

Wind power is clean, reliable, and quick to install; it's the leading electricity generation technology in the fight against climate change, enhancing energy security, stabilising electricity prices, cleaning up our air and creating thousands of quality jobs in the manufacturing sector when they're particularly hard to come by. Early 2009, when we published our last set of five year projections, was the absolute low point of the financial crisis. Capital was largely unavailable in most OECD countries, and bankers and consultancies were all predicting a dramatic drop in the renewable energy sector in general and in wind power in particular. GWEC's prediction of 12{\%} growth in the wind sector was generally greeted with disbelief and derision, figuring we were just trying to put a brave face on disaster.},

abstract = {During the last three decades, a vast variety of methods to numerically solve ordinary differential equations and differential-algebraic equations has been developed and investigated. The methods are mostly freely available in different programming languages and with different interfaces. Accessing them using a unified interface is a need not only of the research community and for education purposes but also to make them available in industrial contexts. An industrial model of a dynamic system is usually not just a set of differential equations. The models today may contain discrete controllers, impacts or friction resulting in discontinuities that need to be handled by a modern solver in a correct and efficient way. Additionally, the models may produce an enormous amount of data that puts strain on the simulation software. In this paper, Assimulo is presented. It is a unified high-level interface to solvers of ordinary differential equations and is designed to satisfy the needs in research and education together with the requirements for solving industrial models with discontinuities and data handling. It combines original classical and modern solvers independent of their programming language with a well-structured Python/Cython interface. This allows to easily control parameter setting and discontinuity handling for a wide range of problem classes.},

The support the PV technology can offer in the next decades, to the rate of growth of the advanced economies as well as of the developing Countries, is very high. The incentives provided at a first stage by the European governments have resulted in the rapid growth of the photovoltaic market and in the increase of the number and quality of products offered by the industries. PV modules by many producers are nowadays commercially available and a number of power electronic systems have been put on the Market for processing the electric power produced by PV systems, especially for grid connected applications. Also the scientific literature concerning PV applications has been characterized by a strong quantitative and qualitative growth in the last decade. A huge number of papers has been written and continues to be published in many journals; moreover, high impact factor scientific journals which are specifically devoted to photovoltaic systems are printed. A significant number of scientific papers is dedicated to the control of the photovoltaic source. A simple search on the Reuters Thomson website reveals that, at the end of May 2012, about 600 papers include the Maximum Power Point Tracking among their keywords. Many authors have contributed to the scientific field of the circuits and systems ensuring the best operation of the photovoltaic generator, but a reference in this field is still lacking.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine whether a multimodal, secondary prevention program (MP) is superior to a general physical exercise program (EP) in influencing the process leading to chronic low back pain (LBP) in nurses with a history of back pain., DESIGN: The study was conducted as a randomized controlled parallel-group trial., SETTING: The interventions were performed in a single center at the Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Munich in Germany., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 235 nurses from 14 nearby hospitals and nursing homes who experienced at least one episode of back pain during the previous 2 years were invited into the study. Of these, 183 nurses were enrolled and 169 (83 in the MP and 86 in the EP) qualified for the intent-to-treat analysis., INTERVENTIONS: The EP consisted of 11 group sessions, each lasting 1 hour. After introductory sessions, subsequent sessions included general physical strengthening and stretching exercises as well as instructions for a home-training program. The MP consisted of 17 group sessions of 1.75 hours and one individual session of 45 minutes. In addition to the full EP, the MP included 5 psychological units, 7 segmental stabilization exercises units, and 8 ergonomic and workplace-specific units., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The primary study end-point variable was pain interference, and the secondary study end-point variables were pain intensity and functioning as measured with the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory and the Short Form-36, respectively. These study end-point variables were defined a priori., RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Small-to-moderate effects were observed in both intervention programs across all study end-point variables. For pain interference, the effect size at 12 months after intervention was 0.58 in the MP and 0.47 in the EP., CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal program is not superior to a general exercise program in influencing the process leading to chronic LBP in a population of nurses with a history of pain. The most likely explanation is a common psychological mechanism leading to improved pain interference that is irrespective of the program used. Considering the lower resources of the general exercise program, the expense for a multimodal program is not justified for the secondary prevention of LBP and disability.},

Discusses some of the assumptions made in using various models and presents the fundamental equations and concepts involved in generator/system interfacing. Covers, generally, the various attributes of power system stability, recognizing two basic approaches. The first is categorized under large disturbance nonlinear analysis; the second approach considers small disturbances, where the corresponding dynamic equations are linearized. Applications of a range of generator models are discussed and treated. The manner in which generator saturation is treated in stability studies, both in the initialization process as well as during large or small disturbance stability analysis procedures is addressed. Saturation functions that are derived, whether from test data or by the methods, of finite elements are developed. Different saturation algorithms for calculating values of excitation and internal power angle depending upon generator terminal conditions are compared. The question of parameter determination is covered. Two approaches in accounting for generator field and excitation system base quantities are identified. Conversion factors are given for transferring field parameters from one base to another for correct generator/excitation system interface modeling, Suggestions for modeling of negative field currents and other field circuit discontinuities are included.},

DEA efficiencies have been obtained under various input/output combinations. A ranking of dot com firms in terms of relative efficiency has been obtained. A method based on multivariate analysis has been proven to be successful at showing the strengths and weaknesses of individual dot com firms. It is shown that there is a relationship between the type of e-business (e-tailers, search/portal, content/communities), and the way in which efficiency is obtained. The paper suggests a new approach to the problem of deciding which inputs and outputs the model should contain.{\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Extensive works exist in literature about modeling solar power generation by photovoltaic cell. However, some fundamental aspects of the design making it flexible and exploitable for other research works remain difficult and unclear under Matlab Simulink. This work proposes an understandable model of PV cell, suitable for upgradability and further use for other designs. After dealing with a sound analytical model on the PV cell, the paper presents a clear modeling under Simulink. The model is designed to take excitation from three inputs including temperature, irradiance and voltage. Simulations were run and results in terms of peak power and current were analyzed. In total the similarities were quite satisfactory as compared to previous works. However, some little differences in the responses of the model to various inputs were observed. These results, further confirm the novelty of the proposed model.},

We decided not put any restriction on the technologies used or plant size in the definition of distributed generation and based our research on the definition putting the emphasis on the connection to the distribution network and the proximity to the consumption point. We first describe the centralized generation paradigm to show that its failure to provide answers for niche generation markets combined with both electricity deregulation and the more stringent environmental constraints paved the way an increasing share of distributed generation over the past years. We then show that to be a credible alternative generation paradigm, distributed generation will have to overcome significant technical, economic, regulatory and environmental hurdles.},

abstract = {A novel switching dc-to-dc converter is presented, which has the same general conversion property (increase or decrease of the input dc voltage) as does the conventional buck-boost converter, and which offers through its new optimum topology higher efficiency, lower output voltage ripple, reduced EMI, smaller size and weight, and excellent dynamic response. One of its most significant advantages is that both input and output current are not pulsating but are continuous (essentially dc with small superimposed switching current ripple), thus resulting in a close approximation to the ideal physically nonrealizable dc-to-dc transformer. The converter retains the simplest possible structure with the minimum number of components which, when interconnected in its optimum topology, yield the maximum performance. The new converter is extensively experimentalluy verified and both the steady stady (dc) and the dynamic (ac) theoretical model are correlated well with the experimental data. Both theoretical and experimental comparisons with the conventional buck-boost converter, to which an input filter has been added, demonstrate the significant advantages of the new optimum topology switching dc-to-dc converter.},

This paper surveys advances in pinning control approaches to making a dynamical networked system have a desired behavior. For a network with fixed topology, we review the feasibility, stability and effectiveness of pinning control. We then focus on pinning-based consensus and flocking control of mobile multi-agent networked systems. One of the main challenges with consensus and flocking control is that the topology of the corresponding dynamical network is time-varying, which depends on the states of all the agents in the network. Looking forward to the next decade, we expect to have a much deeper understanding of the relationship between the effectiveness of pinning control and the structural properties of a complex network, which may result in better control of large scale networked systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recently, the researches on pinning control of complex dynamical networks have mainly focused on such networks with very specific coupling schemes (e.g., symmetric coupling, uniform coupling and linear coupling). However, most real networks often consist of local units, which interact with each other via asymmetric and heterogeneous connections. In this paper, pinning control of a continuous-time complex dynamical network with general coupling topologies is studied. Some generic stability criteria based on master stability function (MSF) are derived for such a general controlled network, which guarantee that the whole network can be pinned to its equilibrium by placing feedback control only on a small fraction of nodes. Then, these results are extended to discrete-time case. Previous results about symmetric, uniform or linear coupled networks in this area are included as special cases of the present work. Numerical simulations of directed networks with weighted coupling pinned by specifically selective pinning scheme are given for illustration and verification. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Denholm2015,
abstract = {n 2013, the California Independent System Operator published the “duck chart,” which shows a significant drop in mid-day net load on a spring day as solar photovoltaics (PV) are added to the system. The chart raises concerns that the conventional power system will be unable to accommodate the ramp rate and range needed to fully utilize solar energy, particularly on days characterized by the duck shape. This could result in “overgeneration” and curtailed renewable energy, increasing its costs and reducing its environmental benefits. This paper explores the duck chart in detail, examining how much PV might need to be curtailed if additional grid flexibility measures are not taken, and how curtailment rates can be decreased by changing grid operational practices. It finds that under business-as-usual types of assumptions and corresponding levels of grid flexibility in California, solar penetrations as low as 20{\%} of annual energy could lead to marginal curtailment rates that exceed 30{\%}. However, by allowing (or requiring) distributed PV and storage (including new installations that are part of the California storage mandate) to provide grid services, system flexibility could be greatly enhanced. Doing so could significantly reduce curtailment and allow much greater penetration of variable generation resources in achieving a 50{\%} renewable portfolio standard. Overall, the work described in this paper points to the need to fully integrate distributed resources into grid system planning and operations to allow maximum use of the solar resource.},

By pinning parts of selected agents, only a small fraction of the pinned agents are controlled by simple feedback controllers, while the other DGAs in the MAS synchronize through the communication coupling among the pinned agents in a distributed manner. The main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) the proposal of a fully distributed control for autonomous microgrids where each agent shares its operation information only with its neighbors, which obviates the requirement for a central controller and complex communication topology; 2) the proposal of a pinning-based control scheme, which reduces the number of controllers, for a predefined consensus can be reached if a small fraction of the pinned agents is controlled; and 3) the proposal of the pinning consensus under uncertain communication topologies that can meet the requirements of line switches and plug-and-play operation. Simulation results are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed scheme.},

This paper develops the modeling and analysis of autonomous operation of inverter-based microgrids. Each sub-module is modeled in state-space form and all are combined together on a common reference frame. The model captures the detail of the control loops of the inverter but not the switching action. Some inverter modes are found at relatively high frequency and so a full dynamic model of the network (rather than an algebraic impedance model) is used. The complete model is linearized around an operating point and the resulting system matrix is used to derive the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues (termed "modes") indicate the frequency and damping of oscillatory components in the transient response. A sensitivity analysis is also presented which helps identifying the origin of each of the modes and identify possible feedback signals for design of controllers to improve the system stability. With experience it is possible to simplify the model (reduce the order) if particular modes are not of interest as is the case with synchronous machine models. Experimental results from a microgrid of three 10-kW inverters are used to verify the results obtained from the model},

abstract = {This Paper presents a modelling of Standalone photovoltaic system with designing the voltage controller for its Battery energy storage element. The Photovoltaic (PV) topology comprises the boost converter to harness the maximum power, the bi directional DC-DC converter to maintain the DC link voltage stable through charging and discharging the battery, and inverter to provide high quality power for local loads. The voltage controller designed for battery is to maintain the highest State of Charge (SoC) while preventing battery overcharge when it is partially loaded ad avoid over discharging when the source is not available. Using MATLAB/SIMULINK the proposed model of isolated PV system is created. Non-linear load is considered here to verify the robustness of the proposed control scheme.},
